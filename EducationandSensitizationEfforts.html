                <h2>Community Outreach Programs</h2>
                <p>Insight into the roadshows, workshops, and seminars aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of the act.</p>
                <p>Efforts are being made to educate and sensitize farmers about the amendments to the Agricultural Produce Act, particularly the receipt book system. The Jamaica Agricultural Society (JAS) has launched a series of road shows across the island
                    to inform farmers about the benefits of using receipt books and to encourage their registration and use. These initiatives aim to protect genuine farmers and ensure that thieves are brought to justice​​. Additionally, the government
                    plans to further amend the Agricultural Produce Act to allow farmers to recover the full cost of their produce if stolen. The proposed amendments include not only increasing fines but also expanding the definition of praedial larceny
                    and simplifying procedures for registering and licensing all handlers of agricultural produce​</p>
