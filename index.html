            <p>A compulsory receipt book system has been introduced for farmers conducting transactions. This measure aims to improve traceability and accountability in the sale and transportation of agricultural produce, making it more difficult for stolen

            <p>The act strengthens the authority of law enforcement agencies to question carriers of agricultural produce and seize goods if a valid receipt cannot be produced. This provision is designed to clamp down on the sale of stolen goods and impose
                accountability on those transporting agricultural produce​</p>
