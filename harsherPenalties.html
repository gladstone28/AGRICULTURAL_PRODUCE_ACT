                <h2>Increased Fines and Imprisonment</h2>
                <p>The maximum fine for praedial larceny has been raised significantly, reflecting the government's commitment to combatting agricultural theft.</p>
                <p>The amendments to the Agricultural Produce Act have introduced harsher penalties for praedial larceny. The maximum fine for breaches under the law has increased significantly, moving from $250,000 or three months in prison to $3 million
                    or three years. This change aims to deter theft and protect farmers' livelihoods more effectively</p>
