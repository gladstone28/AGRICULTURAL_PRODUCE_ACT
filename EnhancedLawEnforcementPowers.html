                <h2>Authority to Question and Seize</h2>
                <p>An overview of the new powers granted to law enforcement for questioning suspects and seizing stolen agricultural goods without immediate proof of ownership.</p>
                <p>The Agricultural Produce Act has been amended to strengthen the authority of law enforcement agencies. Police have been given the power to stop and question carriers of produce if they are suspected of possessing stolen agricultural crops
                    or livestock. If carriers cannot produce a receipt for the goods, the police can take them into custody and seize the goods, placing the burden of proof and all costs incurred on the carrier​​.
